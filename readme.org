#+title: Emacs Config

The programming is guess what: the programming thing.
This is just my emacs config file, nothing special.

To evaluate it, just run: ~C-x C-s~, ~C-c C-v t~, and finally, ~M-x load-file <return> $HOME/.emacs.d/init.el~ (or wherever you saved it to).
After that, you can just do ~C-c M-p~ to open the config, and ~M-x my/load-init~ to reload it.
